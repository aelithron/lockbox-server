# lockbox-server
Official server for `The Lockbox`, a secure and private platform for dropping messages. \
This is only the server, the web-based client (and more details about this project) can be found in [lockbox-client](https://github.com/aelithron/lockbox-client).\
I'm building this for Hack Club's Siege event!
